// the maximum number of packets that can be queued

// For sockets that need to transfer a lot of data (iperf, for example),
// especially on slow conenctions this limit prevents running out of memory
// because the MAC transfer cannot keep up with the UDP packet allocation rate
// imposed by the aapplication.

// and the amount of memory available to the stack.
